- no need to say in the git commit messages that they were generated by AI or an agent.
- you don't need to add "co authored by claude" or anything of the sort to commit messages. They should look like they're coming from me.

## Plan File Management

### Plan File Location

**Store plan files in the project's `.claude/plans/` directory**, not the global `~/.claude/plans/`:
- Path: `{project-root}/.claude/plans/{description}.md`
- Create the directory if it doesn't exist
- This keeps project-specific plans with their project

### Naming Convention

When creating plan files, use descriptive names instead of random strings:
- Format: `{description}.md` (no project prefix needed since they're in the project folder)
- Examples: `uber-shader.md`, `clipping-system.md`, `auth-refactor.md`
- Keep descriptions short but meaningful (2-4 words, hyphenated)

### Marking Plans as Complete

**FIRST LINE Convention**: When a plan is complete, add this as the very first line:
```
# COMPLETE - {date}
```

Example:
```markdown
# COMPLETE - 2025-12-18

# Original Plan Title
...rest of plan...
```

### Completion Verification

**IMPORTANT: Never assume a plan is complete. Always verify with the user.**

Before marking a plan as complete:
1. Review all tasks/steps in the plan
2. Confirm each was actually implemented
3. **ASK THE USER**: "The plan in `{filename}` appears to be complete. Can you confirm this work is done so I can mark it complete?"
4. Only add the `# COMPLETE` line after user confirmation

Falsely closing out plans loses track of unfinished work - this is bad!
